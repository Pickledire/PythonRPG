    "Stalls set up where no road leads; lanterns hang from hooks that don't cast shadows.",
    "Vendors drape their wares in sighs: a jar of rain kept from falling, a smile borrowed from winter.",
    "A hound asleep on a rug dreams with its eyes open and its nose closed.",
    "Coins here are stories; they clink in your pocket when you remember them.",
    "A seller of glimmers offers one that looks like your reflection finally agreeing.",
    "At the market's center, a stump serves as a scale: heart on one side, twig on the other.",
    "The crier rings a bell with no clapper; the sound arrives from your childhood.",
    "You realize the market opens for those who don't look for it and closes for those who stay."
